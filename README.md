# Set Up a Local Repository with Git

In this activity, we will explore configuring the local Git default branch to `main`. We will also review another way to create a repository, using the `git init` command. Lastly, we will review the `git pull` command.

Git is an important tool that allows developers to track and store versions of content. It also enables you to collaborate and share code with others. During this boot camp, you'll use Git to share code via a class repository, which you'll be required to pull down before each class. In addition, for each Challenge, you'll provide the grading team with a link to the GitHub repository that contains your code.

## Configure Local Git Default Branch to main

First we need to set the local Git default branch to `main`.

Historically, the most common name for the main body of a codebase has been `master`. However, `main` has been gaining in popularity. In fact, GitHub now uses `main` as the default name for its repositories&mdash;as do the projects in this course.
